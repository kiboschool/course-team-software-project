# MVP Demos

Demos are a way to show what you've built to a broader community, and get feedback on what you've done so far.

In week 5 (on May 9), we will host MVP Demos. Your team will present your project MVP to the class and to the project sponsor or stakeholders.

You will have 5 minutes to discuss the problem your project solves, demonstrate the features in the MVP, and discuss what is coming next.

Demos _must_ show the project's features. Slides are allowed, but not required. 

As you watch the other demos, you will share feedback on what your peers have created so far. Each team will take this feedback and use it to improve their work before the final presentations.

## Submission

Upload a video of your MVP Demo presentation. You can either record the presentation you give to the class, or you can make a separate recording of your demo.

Submit your video in Gradescope and Woolf.
