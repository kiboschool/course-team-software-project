# Final Project Presentation

## Guidelines

For your final project presentations, you will use an [Ignite](https://www.ignitetalks.io/) format.  In an Ignite talk,
you have 5 minutes and 20 slides, with the slides automatically advancing every 15 seconds.  

We are using th Ignite format to encourage conciseness, clarity, and preparation. It's a fun challenge, like a friendly
race against the clock, where you and your team get to showcase your ideas in bite-sized, super-focused snippets.
There's always a bit of a thrill (and some laughs) when juggling those 15-second slides. Plus, it's a great way to level
up your presentation skills, learn to cut to the chase, and really think on your feet--valuable stuff for your future
endeavors!

#### Conclusion (2 Slides | 30 Seconds)
