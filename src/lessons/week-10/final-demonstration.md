# Final Project Presentation

Your task is to create a 3-5 minute video demonstrating the key features and functionalities of your web application. This video should showcase your team's work, the application's capabilities, and how it meets the goals set out in your project brief.

## Steps for Creating the Video

1. **Planning:**
   - Outline the key features and functionalities you want to showcase.
   - Create a storyboard or script to structure your video. This should include what you will say and show at each stage of the demonstration.
   - Assign roles among team members (e.g., narrator, video editor).

2. **Setting Up:**
   - Choose a quiet location with good lighting for recording.
   - Ensure your computer screen is clear of unrelated tabs and windows.
   - Use screen recording software that can capture both the screen and audio (e.g., OBS Studio, Camtasia).

3. **Recording the Video:**
   - Begin with a brief introduction of your team and the web application.
   - Proceed to demonstrate the application, highlighting its main features. Explain how each feature works and its purpose.
   - Make sure to navigate the application in real-time to give viewers a sense of its user experience and performance.
   - Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Ensure technical terms are explained for clarity.

4. **Editing:** (This may not be necessary if you plan your video well)
   - Use video editing software to trim unnecessary parts, correct errors, and ensure smooth transitions.

5. **Finalizing:**
   - Review the video for clarity, quality, and length. Make sure it stays within the 3-5 minute limit.
   - Ensure the video reflects a professional standard suitable for showcasing to an external audience.

## Content Guidelines
