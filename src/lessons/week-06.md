# Introduction

During Weeks 6 and 7 of the Team Software Project, each team will have an individual meeting with the instructor. These meetings provide an opportunity for direct feedback, guidance, and assessment of the team's progress. The instructor will review the work completed so far, discuss challenges, and provide insights for future development phases.  These meetings should be driven by the students and focus on areas where they are seeking guidance.

## Meeting Structure

1. **Review of Progress**: The meeting will typically begin with a review of the team's progress. This includes discussing the milestones achieved, tasks completed, and any deliverables submitted.

2. **Informal Presentation**: Teams should plan to demo their progress or challenges that they've encountered This could involve a brief demonstration of the software developed, a walkthrough of the code, or a presentation of the project's documentation.

3. **Feedback Session**: The instructor will provide feedback on the work presented. This could cover code quality, adherence to project specifications, team collaboration, and problem-solving approaches.

4. **Discussion of Challenges**: Teams will have the opportunity to discuss any challenges or obstacles they are facing. This is a time to seek advice and solutions from the instructor.

5. **Guidance for Future Work**: The meeting will conclude with the instructor providing guidance on what the team should focus on in the upcoming weeks, including setting new goals and adjusting project plans if necessary.

## Preparation for the Meeting

1. **Review Project Goals**: Prior to the meeting, revisit the project's objectives and requirements. Ensure that all team members are clear about what has been achieved and what is still pending.

2. **Organize Documentation**: Make sure all documentation is up-to-date and organized. This includes code documentation, project logs, meeting notes, and any reports or presentations.

3. **Provide Context**: Give an overview of the current state of your work.  Your team will be intimately familiar with all the details of your project, but your instructor won't be.  Highlight key achievements, review your designs, and mention interesting challenges you overcame and innovative solutions your team developed.

4. **Compile Questions and Concerns**: List down any specific questions or concerns you want to address during the meeting. This could be related to technical challenges, team dynamics, resource needs, or clarification on project requirements.

5. **Internal Team Meeting**: Have a meeting with your team before the session with the instructor. Discuss and agree on the main points you will present, and ensure every team member knows their part.

## Importance of the Meeting

These meetings are crucial for receiving direct feedback from the instructor, which can be instrumental in guiding the future direction of the project. Itâ€™s also an opportunity for teams to reflect on their teamwork and problem-solving strategies. Proper preparation and active participation during these meetings can significantly enhance the learning experience and the overall quality of the project.
