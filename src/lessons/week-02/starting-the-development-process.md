# Starting the Development Process

## Pre-Implementation Phase

Before you commence the implementation phase of a software project, it's crucial to ensure that you have the following
in place:

- A comprehensive understanding of the project requirements.
- A clear comprehension of the project scope that you will initially deploy and deliver.
- A well-defined team charter and team roles.
- A prioritized backlog of user stories and features.

Also prioritize the most significant features that the users will value and that you will gain insights from. This way,
you can guarantee that you have a functioning product to showcase to your stakeholders and users.

### Starting with the User Interface

Assuming that you have a clear understanding of the user's interaction with the system (i.e., user journey or user
flow), you can begin by building the user interface for the first page the user will see. This approach will help you
obtain a clear understanding of the data that you need to work with and what type of backend services you need.

If you choose to begin with the user interface, it's recommended that you focus solely on the first page(s) that the
user will interact with and complete this feature before moving on to the remaining interface of the system.

### Starting with Data Models

Another approach that I frequently use is to begin with the data models (or database). Creating the data models provides
me with a clear comprehension of the objects and interactions in the system. Following this, I revisit the requirements
and user stories to ensure that my data model aligns with the system's features. Next, I begin implementing the database
and backend services needed solely for the first feature that I'm developing. Afterward, I finish the user interface for
that feature before moving on to the next one.

### During Implementation

During the development, ensure that you finish both the frontend and backend components of a feature before proceeding
to the next one. This way, you can avoid leaving loose ends and create a more cohesive implementation. Repeat this
approach for the subsequent features as well.

Note that the previous approaches are meant to be used as a guideline. You can always modify them to suit your needs and
the project's requirements.
