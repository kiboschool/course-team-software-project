# Personal Reflections

Reflection is a key part of learning.

Each week, you'll submit a short personal reflection in Gradescope. You'll reflect on what you did and how the project is going. 

There are **8 personal reflections** to submit.

## Peer Ratings

Included in the weekly reflection is a peer rating, where you'll score your own and your teammates weekly contribution to the project.

Peer ratings are intended to promote accountability, and foster teamwork. Your individual peer ratings are confidential (we won't share the scores you submit with your teammates). However, instructors will use the peer ratings to spot teams that may need additional support in collaborating effectively. Peer ratings will factor into your course grade. Teammates that do not contribute to the team's project will not receive the full points for that project.

## Submission

You'll submit each personal reflection in Gradescope. Submit a screenshot your answers in Woolf.
