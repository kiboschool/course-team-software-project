# Projects

This course will revolve around a project you build from scratch with a team. In order to focus your time within the course on the software and collaboration aspects of the project, teams will select from a set of project proposals.

## Project Proposals

Project Sponsors submit ideas for projects that teams will work on. They will also serve as project stakeholders during the course, and attend project demos. 

Project sponsors can be students, staff, or friends of Kibo â€“ anyone who has an idea they would like students to build.

Project Proposals require:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Design Sketches
- A 3-minute Pitch Video

These requirements are intended to help teams focus on building the software for the project, not doing design work and figuring out what the product is supposed to do. The design work should be done ahead of time, and captured in the Project Proposals.

Project Proposals are due **Tuesday, April 11**.

To read more about proposing a project, see [Team Software Project: Project Proposals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snuzlYDfB50LwmOS2PsZfusIakWCz1QqbaUnne8objo/edit#). To submit a project, read that doc and submit [Kibo Team Software Project Proposal (Google Forms)](https://forms.gle/kk2khUeGFGqMqqkR6).

## Team Formation

In week 1, you'll fill out a team formation form. You will indicate whether you have a team and project idea already, or if you would like to be placed on a team. You'll also indicate which of the project proposals you are interested in.

After teams are formed, you will have a team kickoff meeting to introduce yourselves, agree on meeting times and tools for collaboration, decide on the sprint report calendar, and form any other team policies. You will also share your goals and ideas for the project, and start planning how you will build your MVP.

- Teams must have 2 to 4 students. 
- Solo projects are not permitted.
- Teams of more than 4 are not permitted.

## MVP Planning

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest feasible version of an application, that allows you to demonstrate and get feedback about what you are building. When building a large software project, it is critical to build an MVP or prototype as quickly as possible, so that you can get feedback and make decisions early on about what features to keep, cut, change, or add.

After you've formed your team and agreed on how you will work together, you will plan the features to include in the MVP version of your project and the set of technologies you will use so you can start building.
