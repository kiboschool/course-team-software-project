# Final Projects

At the end of the course, you'll submit your team's project, present it to stakeholders, and write a personal reflection on how the project went.

The project, presentation, and reflection will each count for 20% of your overall course grade. The project and presentation will be submitted with your team. The reflection is an individual submission.

- Final Project, Presentation, and Reflection: 60%
  - Project: 20%
  - Presentation: 20%
  - Reflection: 20%

## Project

You'll use Github to collaborate on your project with your team, and you may use some hosting service to deploy your application. You will submit the finished project at the end of the course.

Each team will submit their final project on Gradescope and Woolf. 

It will be scored based on:

- Fit to the problem statement
- Functionality
- Features
- Quality

## Presentation

At the end of the term, your team will present your project to the project sponsor, class, and any other project stakeholders.

You'll have 8 minutes to explain the problem, present your application, demonstrate its features, and discuss the challenges and things you learned during the project.

We will present projects in Weeks 9 and 10. Teams will also submit a recording of their project presentation. You can either submit the recording of the presentation you deliver to the class, or make a separate video recording.

## Reflection

At the end of the course, you'll submit a reflection on your experience with the team project. You'll write about what you learned about software and teamwork, the challenges you faced, and what you are proud of from the project.

It may be helpful to reread your weekly reflections and team sprint reports, to help recall the progress and challenges over the course of the term.

### Peer Ratings

Included in the final project reflection is a peer rating, where you'll score your own and your teammates overall contribution to the project.

Peer ratings are intended to promote accountability, and foster teamwork. Your individual peer ratings are confidential (we won't share the scores you submit with your teammates). However, instructors will use the peer ratings to spot teams that may need additional support in collaborating effectively. 

Peer ratings will factor into your course grade. Teammates that do not contribute to the team's project will not receive the full points for that project.

## Submission

One team member should submit the project files and demo recording in Gradescope. Every team member must submit their own Personal Reflection. Every team member should submit all the materials in Woolf.
