# Source Version Control

Source version control, also known as version control or source control, is the management of changes to source code or other files. It helps developers track changes to code and collaborate with others on a project.

## Some benefits of using version control include:

- Version control provides a history of changes, allowing developers to see who made changes and when they were made.
- It enables collaboration between developers, allowing them to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
- It allows for the easy rollback of changes if a mistake is made.
- It helps with code review, as changes can be reviewed before they are merged into the main codebase.
