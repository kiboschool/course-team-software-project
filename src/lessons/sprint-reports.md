# Sprint Reports

A sprint report is a way to keep your team and any stakeholders aligned on the team's goals and progress. 

Each week, your team will write a sprint report on the progress on the project. It should contain links to the artifacts that the team created that week, like commits on Github, files on Figma, plans in Google docs, or some other URL representing the work you did.

The Sprint report is a team submission, but responsibility for writing the sprint report will rotate between team members each week. When you form your team, you should agree on a schedule for who is responsible for each of the Sprint Reports.

Except for the weeks of the MVP Demos and the Final Presentations, your team will submit a Sprint Report each week. 

There are **6 sprint reports** to submit.

## Submission

One person from your team should submit the weekly sprint report in Gradescope. _Every team member_ should submit a screenshot your answers in Woolf.
