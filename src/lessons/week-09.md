# Debugging and Office Hours

As you approach the final week of the term, you are probably working on tying up loose ends, and resolving any long-standing bugs in your web application.  Remember that it is preferable to have fewer high quality and complete features rather than many features that are only partially complete or very buggy.  

To assist with you working through these problems, you are encouraged to schedule time with course staff to solve any final problems and receive guidance.

Good luck!  We are excited to see all the results of your hard work this team!
