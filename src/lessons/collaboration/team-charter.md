# Team Charter

The [projects page](/lessons/projects) outlines how projects are proposed and how teams are formed.

Once you have your team and project assignment, you'll meet with your team to write a Team Charter and plan your MVP. Then, you'll start working in weekly sprints to complete your project.

## Team Charter

A team charter is a written agreement between the team members about the goals, expectations, and processes the team will use to collaborate. It helps everyone get on the same page about how the team will work together.

- Schedule one hour for your team to meet and create the Team Charter
- Make one copy the [Team Charter Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14BSMjp7LEjLBVrlyhBNvUS_FiIEs2IQfIEZiMea_P3s/copy) for the team to work on together, and share it with all the team members.
- Discuss together the way your team will work and fill out the Team Charter document. It will guide you through planning and deciding different aspects of your team's processes and expectations
