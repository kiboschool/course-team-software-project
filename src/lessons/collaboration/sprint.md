# Weekly Sprint

Each week, you'll work together to add more features to your project. You'll collaborate on design, coding, and project management.

## Sprint Lead

One team member will act as the _Sprint Lead_. The sprint lead is responsible for:
- Taking team meeting notes
- Sharing action items from meetings in the team's tracking tool
- Following up with teammates about their progress on tasks
- Writing the team's weekly sprint report
- Reminding teammates to submit their individual reflection

## Sprint Planning

On Mondays (or early in the week), you should have a team meeting to plan the sprint. The goal is to break down the features on your roadmap into tasks that each teammate can accomplish during the week's sprint. Usually, the smaller the tasks are, the more clear everyone's responsibilities and next steps are.

The Sprint Lead should add and assign the tasks to your project management tool (e.g. Asana).

## Sprint Report

At the end of the week, the Sprint Lead should ask the team for what tasks they completed during the week, and submit the Weekly Sprint Report.

- Fill out the sections of the template
- Link to the work for each task (e.g. a Git commit or a design file)
- Submit the group assignment in Gradescope. _Every teammate should submit a copy in Woolf_.

## Individual Reflection

Each week, every team member will fill out an individual reflection.
