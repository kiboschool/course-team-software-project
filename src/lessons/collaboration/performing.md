## Focusing on Results

Creating and maintaining alignment around desired team outcomes is one of the greatest challenges team members and leaders face. The need to keep priorities aligned and everyone heading in the right direction is critical to achieving the team’s desired impact.

## How do we make a team focused on results?

Lencioni explains in his work that two things are what prevents members of a team focus on results: Self-interest and self-preservation.

He explains that people mostly have tendency to look out for themselves before others, which should impact teamwork, and eventually team trust at the core of the pyramid. To avoid the latter, it is advised that results should be in the forefront of people’s minds. A good way to focus attention is to use a visible scoreboard of some kind. 

Why a scoreboard? Consider a football team. On a football field, a scoreboard focuses everyone’s efforts on one thing: winning. It doesn’t display defensive statistics or offensive statistics or individual player statistics. It provides unambiguous information about how the team is doing, and how much time the members have left if they want to improve the final outcome. That leaves little room for individual interpretation and the only thing a team has to do to know whether it’s winning is to look at the scoreboard.

To measure results, the team has to pick a standard so that team members have something they can collectively focus upon and around which they can rally.  Results-oriented teams establish their own measurements for success. They don’t allow themselves room for subjectivity. They also commit, early and publicly, to what they will achieve, and by constantly reviewing their progress against those expected achievements (a.k.a. the scoreboard). 

## Distractions

When players on a team stop caring about the scoreboard, they inevitably start caring about something else, their self-interest. There are three distractions that have impact on teams achieving already set results:

**1) Ego,** or wanting to win as an individual first before the team, is the first thing that negatively impacts the success of teams in achieving results.  On strong teams, no one is happy until
everyone is succeeding, because that’s the only way to achieve the collective results of the group. Of course, this implies that individual egos are less important than team achievements.

**2) Career Development and Money:** Even the most altruistic team members will at times have to focus on their own career advancement and financial needs. A great team will understand those needs, and the validity of them, but not let them distract the team from achieving the collective goals. The key to doing that is being open about what people need, and not making them feel guilty or selfish for acknowledging those needs. If team members trust one another, then they’re willing to be vulnerable. If there is trust among team members, no one will take the comment as selfish or anti-team. In fact, they should be glad that the person put the issue on the table for everyone to help with, because if they don’t, then it will eventually fester and create problems that impact the team’s performance. And after all, the performance of the team is what matters. Anything that stands in the way of performance must be addressed openly and directly, even if it is something that is sensitive to one or more members of the team. 

**3) Department Identity:** This is perhaps the most subtle and dangerous distraction of all because well-intentioned team members often succumb to it, and because they actually wear it as a badge of honor. The departmental identity distraction is the tendency of team members to place a higher priority on the team they lead than they place on the team they are a member of. Rather than coming together to make the best possible decision for the entire organization, they become lobbyers for their own constituents. In essence, whenever push comes to shove, they compete with their teammates rather than collaborate with them.
