# Bonus: Emotional Intelligence

> “But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job.” 
>
> **- Daniel Goleman***

In the previous course, ‘Optimizing your Learning’, you had the chance to learn about two main components of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) related to the ‘Self’ (i.e., Self Awareness and Self Management). Here, you will get to learn about the other two components of EQ related to the ‘Other’, namely Social Awareness and Relationship Management.  To refresh your learning, and get a general understanding of the other two components of EQ, review the graphic below.

## Social Awareness

After refreshing your understanding of EQ and its four components, in this section of the course, we will be digging deeper into the ‘Self’ part of EQ and how it relates to Collaboration.

In this first section of the course, we are going to:

1. Describe the concept of social awareness. 
2. Review how social awareness is practiced in academic and professional situations.
3. Reflect on diverse social situations to strengthen our social awareness. 

> Watch this video to learn about Social Awareness and respond to reflective questions at the end of the video using the Padlet below.

### Types of Social Awareness

Different skills contribute to a person developing their social awareness, and by practicing them in your daily interactions, you can further develop your social awareness. Some of the most important skills for Social Awareness development are enlisted below:

- **Emotional Awareness:**  is the capacity to recognize one's own emotions and the impact those emotions can have on others.
- **Self Regulation**: is the capacity of a person to maintain composure and refrain from reacting emotionally in a social setting. This is accomplished by being conscious of their escalating emotions and using cognitive techniques to suppress those irrational thoughts.
- **Empathy:** is a person’s ability to comprehend the emotions and state of mind of another. People can better relate to others because they can comprehend the reasoning behind their own actions and emotions in social situations.
- **Active Listening:** is carefully listening to another individual while offering nonverbal clues and affirmations to let them know you are paying attention. The listener may nod in agreement, summarize what the speaker is saying, or offer commentary that is pertinent to the conversation.
- **Kindness:** is the trait of treating others with warmth and affability. This means being generous and considerate to other people.
- **Cooperation** is the ability to collaborate with others to achieve a common objective. Compromise, active listening, and the use of empathic communication techniques may all be part of this.
- **Respect:** is appreciating human worth. It involves valuing someone else and their principles and values.

### Scenarios from the field

Read the scenarios below and in your notes, reflect on:

- What did not go well?
- How can it be avoided?
- Which types of Social Awareness these people should further develop?

**Scenario 1:**

Adamma is a very enthusiastic engineer. He is always at the top of his tasks and  delivers his projects to clients on time. While his boss appreciates his work ethics and quality, he started handing him big projects that require a lot of effort, and with a short notice. Adamma’s enthusiasm started to decline, and with his work load, quality also started to drop. 

**Scenario 2:**

Aisha, a new employee at a tech company, worked very hard on her presentation for the weekly team meeting. She sent it out to her colleague Edna for a quick review and for feedback. Being a new employee Aisha is very stressed about her presentation, yet Edna instead of giving her the feedback she asked for, told her ‘it’s just a silly presentation, you are overstressing’. Aisha’s facial expressions changed to pale and she left Edna’s office in a rush.

**Scenario 3:**

Tina was having a bad work day and needed someone to hear her thoughts. She went on to her work colleague, Tom, during their lunch break to vent. As she was telling her concerns and explaining why she was feeling what she was feeling, Tom kept checking his phone notifications and randomly flipping the pages of a report he had on the table. Tina stopped talking and ate her lunch before she left, without Tom noticing his reluctance to share anymore.

> Different skills contribute to a person developing their social awareness, and by practicing them in your daily interactions, you can further develop your social awareness. Some of the most important skills for Social Awareness development are listed below.

## Empathy

> Let’s first watch the video below to get a better understanding of ‘Empathy’ as a skill and how it is different from Sympathy. Both terms are mistakenly used interchangeably, and for us to have a better understanding of the skill of ‘Empathy’ we will review it in comparison with Sympathy.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-top:1.6em"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Evwgu369Jw;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Empathy is the ability to emotionally understand **how others** feel, see things from **their own perspective,**  and imagine yourself **in their place.** In essence, it means being in the position **of others**  and feeling what **they** are feeling. Empathy in reality means when you see a colleague at school or at work struggling with a skill, you show reasonable concern and support them as they grow that specific skill they are struggling with. It also means avoiding quick judgement when a colleague reacts in a way that was not ‘normal’ or ‘appropriate’ during a social encounter. It requires to be an active listener, asking the right questions, and approaching situations with objectivity. Although, Empathy entails feeling with others, it is also important to practice how not to get so emotionally invested.

### Empathic Collaboration

To bring innovative and creative solutions to group work, it is important that everyone in the team is respected, included and has a say in the decision making. And that is only possible when a safe space is created for everyone to do so. Brining together different perspectives into a group task or a project, requires Empathy as a driving vehicle for those conversations and negotiations for it to be effective. There are four suggested steps by which a team can strengthen their Empathy as a skill during collaborative work:

#### 1. Create a welcoming space for diverse perspectives

As a team player or leader, always ensure that everyone gets a chance to talk, share their opinion and explain their concerns as the team works on a task or project. 

#### 2. Create opportunities to build trust

When diverse team members find a safe space to share their ideas and thoughts, their opinions are not disregarded, they aren’t feeling judged for sharing their perspective trust is the outcome of such practices. 

#### 3. Turn tensions and frictions to positive learning experiences

Tensions naturally arise when different opinions are suggested among by different members. This, however, should not be approached badly, instead team members should approach the situation with open mindedness, assume the best in others and that their intension is to contribute to the task or project at hand. 

#### 4. Support others to succeed

The growth of one person does not impact that of other team members, and this should be a guiding rule in every team. Highlighting areas of strength of each member, praising their efforts and work, and calling on them as experts of a given task all builds strong teams. 

By following the suggested steps above, each team member, and leader, will be able to develop very strong team dynamics, and increases the chances for empathic collaboration among their team.

## Active Listening

As you might have covered in the course ‘Communicating for Impact’, Active Listening or ‘Careful Listening’ is one of the most crucial communication skills that everyone needs to practice and master. In this section of the course, we will go over some tips on how Active Listening can be practiced. 

> Watch the video below and review the core principles of Active Listening outlined below the video.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-top:1.6em"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wUCyjiyXdg;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

**Below are four core principles of active listening:** 

#### 1. Physical Attention

  -  Face the person who is talking.

  -  Notice the speaker’s body language; does it match what he/she is saying?

  -  Can you match the speaker’s body language?

  -  Try not to do anything else while you are listening.

#### 2. Paraphrasing

  - Show you are listening and understanding what is being said.

  - Check the meaning and your interpretation.

  - Restate basic ideas and facts.

  - Check to make sure your understanding is accurate by saying:

    “It sounds like what you mean is… Is that so?”

    “So what happened was… Is that correct?”

#### 3. Reflecting

  - Show that you understand how the person feels.

  - Help the person evaluate his or her feelings after hearing them expressed by someone else.

  - Reflect the speaker’s feelings by saying:

    “Are you saying that you’re angry/disappointed/glad, because…?”

    “It sounds like you feel…”

#### 4. Clarifying

- Help clarify what is said.

- Get more information.

- Help the speaker see other points of view.

- Use a tone of voice that conveys interest.

- Ask open-ended questions, as opposed to yes/no questions, to elicit more information.

#### 5. Encouraging

- Show interest by saying

“Can you tell me more about that?”

“Really?”

“Is that so?”

## Bridging Understanding

In this lesson, you got to know more about social awareness and relationship management in detail. You learned how important it is to be an empath, an active listener, a good communicator, a person who manages their anger in social situations and pays close attention to their non-verbal cues and tone in different social situations.

In this section of the course, we will get to review much of this learning through a mental exercise, where you will get introduced to the ‘5 Chairs’ metaphor. Watch the video below, and take notes of the key messages from the video, for you to use for the post-video activity, and as a reference to regulating your behaviors, and managing your reactions to other people’s behaviors.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-top:1.6em"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7wOyNtsQzM;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

> Now that you have a general understanding of the ‘5 Chairs’, take time to reflect on your reaction to unpleasant social situations, or when someone pushes your ‘red button. Use the Padlet space below to respond to this scenario and what would be your habitual reaction to it.

### Scenario: Client communication

You went overboard in building a website for a regular customer. You spent so much time preparing it on time, and ensuring all the details requested by the customer are included and refined. After you shared it with them, they contacted the manager of your entity and asked for a different developer for their next project without explaining why they are requesting this change.

1. What would be your instant reaction to the client's behavior?
2. Will your instant reaction have a negative impact on your relationship as a service provider and former customer?
3. How would you avoid sitting in the ‘Attack’ or ‘Self-doubt’ chairs in this situation?
4. How do you see the learning from this experience being applied to your academic and professional careers? 

As you write your response, please comment on two of your friends’ responses and how you relate or would use a different way to address the situation.
