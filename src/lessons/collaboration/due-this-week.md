## 3. Schedule your team's first meeting

Before the next week, schedule your team's first meeting. We recommend the meeting to be on Mondays but you are free to pick the time that works for your team.

This meeting should be used to discuss the project, the team charter, and the team's goals for the first sprint.

Before the meeting, make sure to read the project proposal and get a sense of what the project is about. You should also read the <a href="https://team-software-project.vercel.app/lessons/collaboration/team-charter.html"> team charter </a> to get a sense of what you should discuss in the meeting.
