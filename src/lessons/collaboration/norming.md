## Building Trust

Team members who trust one another learn to be comfortable being open, even exposed, to one another around their failures, weaknesses and even fears. Trust is the foundation of any successful relationship, both personal and professional and when it’s broken, it is extremely hard to repair. When employees feel they can’t trust leadership they feel unsafe, like no one has their back, and then spend more energy on self-preservation and job hunting than performing at their job.

> Jenny is an IT specialist at a sales company. Jenny wanted to request leave days during the month of January, which is usually a very hectic period at her company. To avoid any complications, jenny asks her supervisor to support her request ensuring her that she will make sure she works harder to finish all her tasks by then. Jenny's supervisor promised to support her request. When it was time to request her to leave, Jenny was surprised that her supervisor rejected her request for leave saying that she needs everyone on the team to be present. What do you expect Jenny's reaction to be?

- Jenny will understand and will immediately continue working.
- Jenny will be upset and will lose motivation to do her work.
- Jenny will develop trust issues when it comes to requesting support from her supervisor.

## Building Trust: Action Plan

Are you ready to build more trust? Here’s an action plan to get you started:

1. Think about a relationship where you would like to improve trust.
2. Write down 3 things you respect about them – who they are, what they do, and how they do it.
3. Write down what you could tell them to show your respect and appreciation.
4. What are some questions you could ask them to better understand their priorities and get their feedback on how you could work together more effectively?
5. Have a conversation about the above points.
6. Share your priorities and your ideas for how you could work together better.
7. Clarify your expectations and ask them what they expect of you.

## Achieving Commitment

Like trust, conflict is important not in and of itself but because it enables a team to overcome the next dysfunction: the lack of commitment. And like its predecessors, commitment needs to be correctly defined before it can be achieved. Commitment is not consensus. Waiting for everyone on a team to agree intellectually on a decision is a good recipe for mediocrity, delay, and frustration. Commitment is something of the opposite. It’s about a group of intelligent, driven individuals buying into a decision precisely when they don’t naturally agree. In other words, it’s the ability to defy a lack of consensus.

> Watch this video to understand how to go from conflict to commitment. As you watch the video, make sure you notice how is commitment different from consensus, the drawbacks of achieving consensus, and how a leader helps their team achieve commitment.

> Read the scenario below carefully and share your answer in the attached Padlet. Make sure you comment on at least one of your colleagues’ responses sharing your own opinion about their response.

**Scenario 1:** 

Tina supervises a tech company of 30 staff members. The company received two projects at the same time, same pay, and same workload, but they can only take on one. A poll was sent out to staff to pick their preferred project to work on as a team, and the poll’s results revealed a 50%/50% preference for each of the projects. Tina called for a meeting to discuss the decision and achieve commitment to the chosen project. What should Tina do first? How can she help her team reach commitment and not consensus?

**Scenario 2:**

Thato and Sara are the only two IT specialists in a large sales company. Because of the workload, Thato stays at the office after work hours, while Sara leaves at the end of the work day. This continued for some time and it resulted in a conflict between the two because Sara thinks Thato is creating expectations at the workplace that she can’t take on, since they both have the same job title and duties. Sara and Thato stopped talking and collaborating with one another over tasks. Their manager, Lina, noticed that there was tension between the two and she requested to speak to both of them individually. What should Lina do? How can she help Sara and Thato reach commitment and not a consensus over their workload management? What are other work issues Lina should deal with as she works on this with her two employees?

## Embracing Accountability

Accountability is the willingness of leaders and team members to remind one another when they are not living up to the performance standards of the group. 

> Watch the video about the importance of Accountability inside of a team and how can staff members encourage it.

## Accountability: High-Performance Team

- Poor performers are managed and held accountable.
- Supporting one another.
- Team clarity.
- Team commitment.
- Leveraging the unique capabilities of one another.

## Accountability: Low-Performance Team

- Missed deadlines and key deliverables.

> Reflect on a previous experience where you were part of a team. How did you manage to keep each other accountable? What did the leader do to encourage a culture of accountability inside the team? what would you do differently next time you are in a team to keep your team members accountable, either as a team member or a leader? Respond to these reflective questions in the form of a short essay of 500 words.
