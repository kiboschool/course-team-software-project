# Due This Week

## 1. Complete your Team Charter

Meet with your team and complete your Team Charter.

## 2. Get your development environment set up

You should have your development environment ready and the project set up by the end of this week. If you haven't already, you should have:

- Git repository set up
- Add your team members as collaborators
- Create a README.md file.
- Make sure all team members have access to the repository and can pull and push changes to it.
- [Optional] Prepare a test server and push your code regulary to it. You can use your local machine in demos, but it will be hard fot stakeholders to see your progress if you don't have a test server.

## 3. Get your backlog set up and ready to go.

Revisit your PRD and select the features you will implement in the project. While doing do, please mind the scope of the project. You should be able to complete the project in 7 weeks. Select the most valuable features and keep the scope in mind. You can always add more features later, but you should be able to complete the project in 7 weeks.
Use your favorite project management tool to create a backlog. You can use Github Projects, Trello, Jira, or any other tool you want. You should have a backlog with the following columns:

- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

The defintition of Done is important. You can agree on a definition of Done with your team. It should be something like: "The feature is implemented and tested and the code is merged to the main branch and deployed to the test server". You should have a way to track your work and keep track of what needs to be done.
