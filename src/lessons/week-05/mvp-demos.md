# MVP Demos

Demos are a way to show what you've built to a broader community, and get feedback on what you've done so far.

In week 5, we will host MVP Demos. Your team will present your project MVP to the class and to the project sponsor or stakeholders.

You will have 5 minutes to discuss the problem your project solves, demonstrate the features in the MVP, and discuss what is coming next.

Demos _must_ show the project's features. Slides are allowed, but not required.

As you watch the other demos, you will share feedback on what your peers have created so far. Each team will take this feedback and use it to improve their work before the final presentations.

## Content Guidelines

1. **Introduction:**
   - Briefly introduce your team and the name of your web application.
   - State the main goal or purpose of the application.

2. **Feature Demonstration:**
   - Clearly demonstrate what your team has completed thus far.  Your team should target completion of 40% of your planned features.  
   - Showcase key features and explain their functionality.
   - Highlight any unique aspects or innovative solutions your team implemented.

3. **Technical Aspects:**
   - Mention the technologies used in building the application (briefly).
   - If relevant, showcase the responsiveness of the application on different devices.

4. **Next Steps & Conclusion:**
   - Conclude with a summary of what was demonstrated.
   - Discuss future directions or potential improvements for the application.

Remember, the goal of this video is to effectively communicate the value and functionality of your web application. Keep it professional, clear, and focused on the key highlights of your project and the future work plans.

### Additional Note

## Submitting Your Work

You will do your demonstration live for your classmates during a Live Class session.  In addition, your work must be submitted to Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

1. Make a recording of your MVP demonstration and upload to YouTube.  Ensure that your upload is accessible (though it may be marked as unlisted).
2. Navigate to the appropriate [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) link.   Only one team member should provide the link to Gradescope
3. Enter the URL of your YouTube video into the form and submit.
4. Upload a copy of your recorded demonstration to Anchor using the form below.  All team members should upload a copy of the team video to Anchor.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your
> work to Anchor before the last day of the term. Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the
