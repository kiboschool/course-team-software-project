# Week 3 Sprint Report

The sprint report is a concise summary of your team's activities, accomplishments, and challenges during the sprint. It helps in tracking progress, identifying issues, and planning future actions.

## Steps for Completion

Update your Project Wiki with a dedicated page containing the following information.  If you adopted the provided
wiki repository, a template has been provided.

1. **Collect Information:**
   - Coordinate with your team members to gather information about their completed tasks.
   - Ensure each member provides a brief summary and relevant links to their work artifacts (e.g., GitHub commits, Figma files, Google Docs, YouTube videos).

2. **Writing the Report:**
   - **Task Accomplishments:**
     - For each completed task, write a one-sentence summary.
     - Include links to the artifacts or evidence of the completed work.
     - Format it in a tabular form with columns for 'Who', 'Link(s)', and 'Task Description'.
   - **Challenges and Blockers:**
     - Describe any challenges the team faced during the sprint.
     - Clearly mention any blockers, specifying who is affected and the nature of the blocker.
     - Do you need assistance with overcoming the blocker?
   - **Plan for Next Week:**
     - Outline the tasks and features your team plans to work on in the next sprint.
     - Assign tasks or features to specific team members when possible.
   - **Additional Observations:**
     - Include any other notes, observations, or reflections that are relevant to the sprint’s progress or team dynamics.

3. **Formatting and Clarity:**
   - Ensure the report is well-structured and easy to read.
   - Use clear and concise language to convey information effectively.
   - Adhere to the provided template for consistency.

4. **Review and Submission:**
   - Before submission, review the report as a team.
   - Ensure that all information is accurate and that every team member agrees with the content.
   - Submit the report as per the instructions and within the deadline.

The sprint report is a collaborative document. It should accurately reflect the team's collective efforts and challenges. Regular and honest communication within the team is key to preparing an effective sprint report. This report is not just a requirement but a tool for reflection and improvement. Engage with the process thoughtfully.

## Evaluation Rubric

### Completeness of the Sprint Report
