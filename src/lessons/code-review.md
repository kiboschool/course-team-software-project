# Code Review

Code reviews are an essential aspect of software development, where a team of developers systematically assesses and critiques the code written by their peers.

The main objective of code reviews is to identify potential issues in the codebase, improve the overall quality of the software, and ensure that it meets the project requirements.

Code reviews help to catch bugs early in the development process, prevent technical debt, and improve team collaboration and communication.

Additionally, code reviews also provide an opportunity for junior developers to learn from senior developers and improve their coding skills.

This week's topic will explore the importance of code reviews, the best practices for conducting them effectively, and the tools and techniques available for automating and streamlining the code review process.
