# The Power of Teamwork and How to do it Well

> Why be a star when you can make a constellation?

Have you ever considered that there is more to success than just individual achievement? Rather than being a lone star in the sky, why not create something even more beautiful and impactful? By collaborating with others and working towards a common goal, you can create a constellation - a group of shining stars that together form a stunning and memorable image. Not only will you have the satisfaction of knowing that you have played a part in something bigger than yourself, but you will also have the opportunity to learn and grow from those around you. 

This is the value of teamwork and collaboration! 

In a world where we are constantly bombarded with messages about the importance of individualism and self-reliance, it's easy to forget the value of collaboration. Working in teams can bring about a whole host of benefits that simply cannot be achieved through individual effort. Not only does collaboration foster creativity and learning, but it also allows us to play to our strengths, boost morale and performance, build a sense of camaraderie, and tackle immense challenges.

Therefore, as you go through the Team Software Project course, you will also be learning how to work together better so that you can really leverage the strengths of your team members to create a truly impactful project.

Summary from the video on why we should work in teams:

1. To foster creativity and learning
2. To play to our strengths
3. To boost morale and performance
4. To build a sense of camaraderie
5. To allow us to tackle immense challenges that we could not handle by ourselves

As mentioned in the video, the Tuckman model of team development is a popular framework used to understand the stages that teams go through as they work together towards a common goal. Developed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965, the model consists of five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Each stage is marked by unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities for growth. By understanding the Tuckman model, teams can better navigate the ups and downs of working together and ultimately achieve greater success.

## Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing

The first stage, **forming**, is a period of testing and orientation in which members learn about each other and evaluate the benefits and costs of continued membership. During this stage, the team focuses their energy on task development by creating clear goals, structure, direction and roles to begin creating trust among the team members. It's a time when individuals may be polite, defer to authority, and try to find out what is expected of them and how they will fit into the team. The behaviour of the team is a reflection of their excitement about the new team and the uncertainty or anxiety they might be feeling about their place on the team.

The second stage, **storming**, is marked by interpersonal conflict as members become more proactive and compete for various team roles. Members try to establish norms of appropriate behaviour and performance standards. During this stage, the team develops tasks to redefine the goals and conflict management. It's possible that the team could become less polite due to frustration and disagreements.

The third stage, **norming**, is where the team develops its first real sense of cohesion as roles are established and a consensus forms around group objectives and a common or complementary team-based mental model. The team focuses their energy on their goals and productivity. During this stage, the team develops an increased sense of comfort by expressing their ideas, feelings, and constructive criticism for the team’s success. Members are more conscious of the effort and achieve group harmony.

The fourth stage, **performing**, is where the team members have learned to efficiently coordinate and resolve conflicts. In high-performance teams, members are highly cooperative, have a high level of trust in each other, are committed to group objectives, and identify with the team. The team accomplishes the tasks and celebrates the progress. During this stage, the team experiences a feeling of satisfaction and shares insights into personal and group processes. They feel attached to the team and feel confident they behave with a doing attitude and are more fluid among members.

We will do a deeper dive into each of these stages in subsequent lessons.
