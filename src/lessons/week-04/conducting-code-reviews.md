# Conducting Code Reviews

Here is a really nice video on pull requests and code reviews:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-top:1.6em"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmIlJYdBgvc?t=113;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Please note that because the video is meant to be a demo, the presenter does not take into account the best practices we cover in this lesson. For example, the presenter does not use apropriate commit and feedback messages.

Here is additional thought on code reviews in Github:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; margin-top:1.6em"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UpBpb0j7IKA;rel=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

# Testing a Pull Request Locally

When you are reviewing a pull request, you may want to pull the changes from the pull request into your local repository to test them out. You can do this by following these steps in the link below:
