## Course Description
In this course, you will enhance your skills for effective teamwork in software development. You'll collaborate in small teams to create web applications, integrating technical knowledge with communication and collaboration techniques from previous courses.

Your main project involves building a feature-rich web application, using modern collaboration tools, version control, and project management practices like sprint planning and reviews. You'll also rotate through different team roles, further developing leadership and emotional intelligence skills.

The course concludes with a showcase of your final project to the Kibo community and external stakeholders, demonstrating your learning and teamwork.


## How the Course Works

This course is different from other courses you've taken at Kibo. You'll spend the whole term building a project with a
team of other students. That doesn't mean that this course is easy! It's a lot of work to build something great
together, and you should expect to spend a lot of time on this class.

The course will be based around a scaffolded team project. The course assignments will focus on the milestones you need
to achieve in order to successfully complete the project and reflect on what you have learned.

- The course starts with _Team Formation_. You will choose a team and a project to work on, and agree on team norms and
  expectations you'll follow.
- Then, your team will start working on the project _MVP_. Each week, you'll meet as a team, update each other on
  progress and blockers, and decide what features to build next.
- In week 5, we'll host _MVP Demos_, where you'll share your project MVPs with the rest of the class. You'll get
  feedback on your progress, and that will help shape the last few weeks of work for your team.
- In week 9, you'll finish your projects and prepare a _Final Project Presentation_. Presentations will occur during the
  week 10

## Meetings

This course will consist of:

- The _Course Kickoff_, _MVP Demos_, and _Final Project Demos_, where the class will come together to start, check in,
  and share what teams built.
- _Weekly Team Meetings_, which you will organize with your team
- _Workshops_, where you will have the opportunity to learn key software and collaboration skills

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Develop and deploy a web application in collaboration with a team.
- Define and outline project objectives, scope, and execution plans.
- Provide meaningful technical and team feedback, and respond effectively to feedback.
- Utilize project management methodologies to organize and lead software projects, including sprint planning, code reviews, and progress tracking.
- Present software projects effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences.
