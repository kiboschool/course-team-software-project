# Assessments & Grading

You overall course grade is composed of these weighted elements:

- 12% Personal Reflections
- 18% Sprint Reports & Team Charter
- 10% MVP Demo
- 20% Final Project Implementation
- 10% Final Project Presentation
- 10% Final Project Demonstration
- 20% Final Project Reflection

## Late Policy

> Late submissions are **not** allowed for any of the assessments in this course. 

## Personal Reflections

Reflection is a key part of learning.

Approximately every other week, you will submit a short personal reflection in Gradescope. You'll reflect on what you did and how the project is going.

## Sprint Reports & Team Charter

Approximately every other week, your team will submit a Sprint Report outlining the details of what they have
accomplished that week, the challenges they have encountered and what their plans are for the next week. 

## MVP Demo

A minimally viable product (MVP) is a basic version of a product with enough features to satisfy early customers and
provide feedback for future product development. During Week 5 of the term you will demonstrate the progress on your
project to your instructor. At this point, sufficient work should be completed to give a strong idea of the direction of
the project and the features you are implementing. In addition, team members should be able to describe their
development process and plans for the remainder of the project.

### Peer Reflections

Included in the weekly reflection is a peer rating, where you'll score your own and your teammates' weekly contributions
to the project.

Peer ratings are intended to promote accountability, and foster teamwork. Your individual peer ratings are confidential
(we won't share the scores you submit with your teammates). However, instructors will use the peer ratings to spot teams
that may need additional support in collaborating effectively. Peer ratings will factor into your course grade.
Teammates that do not contribute to the team's project will not receive the full points for that project.

## Final Project Implementation

You'll use Github to collaborate on your project with your team, and you may use some hosting service to deploy your
application. You will submit the finished project at the end of the course.

Your implementation will be evaluated based on its fit to the problem statement, proper functionality, number of features
implemented (we prefer fewer, high-quality features over many, low-quality features.), and your adherences to good
software engineering practices (documentation, design, testing, etc.).

## Final Project Presentation

At the end of the term, your team will present your project to the project sponsor, class, and any other project
stakeholders.

You'll have 5 minutes to explain the problem, present your application, share its features, and discuss the
challenges and things you learned during the project.

## Final Project Demonstration

In addition to the project presentations, teams will record a 3-5 minute demonstration of their application where
they should walk through the features of their project and show how users interact with it.  This is different from
the project presentation in that you will purely demonstrate your project.

## Final Project Reflection

At the end of the course, you'll submit a reflection on your experience with the team project. You'll write about what
you learned about software and teamwork, the challenges you faced, and what you are proud of from the project.

It may be helpful to reread your weekly reflections and team sprint reports, to help recall the progress and challenges
over the course of the term.

### Peer Ratings

Included in the final project reflection is a peer rating, where you'll score your own and your teammates overall
contribution to the project.

Peer ratings are intended to promote accountability, and foster teamwork. Your individual peer ratings are confidential
(we won't share the scores you submit with your teammates).

Peer ratings will factor into your course grade. Teammates that do not contribute to the team's project will not receive
the full points for that project.
