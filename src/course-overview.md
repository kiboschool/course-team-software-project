## Course Description

In this course, you will practice the skills necessary to work effectively on a professional software product team. By working in small teams to build web applications, you will integrate the technical, communication, and collaboration skills built in previous courses.

You will work together to build a multi-feature web application. You will learn and practice modern technical collaboration tools and practices. Topics covered include using version control for shared repository management, writing technical design documents, and conducting code reviews. You will also practice project management skills, including sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. During each milestone, team members rotate taking on various team roles. Throughout the course, you will also apply and refine the emotional intelligence, team development, and leadership frameworks previously learned. By the end of the course, you should understand and value the various roles within a software product development team, and be able to participate effectively on a product team.

The course culminates in a showcase where you will present your final project to the Kibo community and external stakeholders.

## How the Course Works

This course is different from other courses you've taken at Kibo. You'll spend the whole term building a project with a team of other students. That doesn't mean that this course is easy! It's a lot of work to build something great together, and you should expect to spend a lot of time on this class.

The course will be based around a scaffolded team project. The course assignments will focus on the milestones you need to achieve in order to successfully complete the project and reflect on what you have learned.

- The course starts with _Team Formation_. You will choose a team and a project to work on, and agree on team norms and expectations you'll follow.
- Then, your team will start working on the project _MVP_. Each week, you'll meet as a team, update each other on progress and blockers, and decide what features to build next.
- In week 5, we'll host _MVP Demos_, where you'll share your project MVPs with the rest of the class. You'll get feedback on your progress, and that will help shape the last few weeks of work for your team.
- In week 9, you'll finish your projects and prepare a _Final Project Presentation_. Presentations will be in weeks 9 and 10.

# Assessments & Grading

Your course grade will consist of:

- Personal Reflections: 15%
- Sprint Reports: 15%
- MVP Demo: 10%
- Final Project, Presentation, and Reflection: 60%

See the descriptions on the next few pages for more about each of these assignments.

## Meetings

This course will not have conventional live classes. Instead, meetings will consist of:

- The _Course Kickoff_, _MVP Demos_, and _Final Project Demos_, where the class will come together to start, check in, and share what teams built.
- _Weekly Team Meetings_, which you will organize with your team
- _Workshops_, where you will have the opportunity to learn key software and collaboration skills

Here are the dates for the workshops and events:
